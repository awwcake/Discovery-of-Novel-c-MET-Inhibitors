# Discovery-of-Novel-c-MET-Inhibitors
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with the efficacy of current targeted therapies limited by drug resistance and adverse effects. The receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET has been identified as a promising target for HCC therapy due to its involvement in tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. However, no c-MET inhibitors have been approved for HCC treatment. This study integrates virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations to identify novel c-MET inhibitors with unique structural frameworks. A multi-step virtual screening workflow, incorporating molecular docking, machine learning-based predictions, and molecular dynamics simulations, was employed to identify several promising candidates. Among these, compound 9 exhibited potent c-MET inhibition and selective anti-proliferative effects against the HCC cell line Hep3B. Further molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the binding stability of compound 9 with c-MET, highlighting key interactions that contribute to its inhibitory activity. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of c-MET inhibitors with potential therapeutic applications for HCC.
